<b>A subtle problem of multibyte character string</b><br>
<br>
As per N3485:<br>
<br>
<b>17.5.2.1.4.1 Byte strings [byte.strings]</b><br>
1 A <i>null-terminated byte string</i>, or NTBS, is a character sequence whose
highest-addressed element with defined<br>
content has the value zero (the <i>terminating null</i> character); no other
element in the sequence has the value<br>
zero.168<br>
2 The <i>length</i> of an NTBS is the number of elements that precede the
terminating null character. An empty<br>
NTBS has a length of zero.<br>
<b>17.5.2.1.4.2 Multibyte strings [multibyte.strings]</b><br>
1 A <i>null-terminated multibyte string</i>, or
NTMBS, is an NTBS that constitutes a sequence of valid multibyte<br>
characters, beginning and ending in the initial shift state.170<br>
168) Many of the objects manipulated by function signatures declared in &lt;cstring&gt; (21.7) are character sequences or NTBSs.<br>
The size of some of these character sequences is limited by a length value,
maintained separately from the character sequence.<br>
169) A string literal, such as "abc", is a
static NTBS.<br>
170) An NTBS that contains characters only from the basic execution character
set is also an NTMBS. Each multibyte character<br>
then consists of a single byte.<br>
<br>
The meaning of NTBS is quite clear. But I have problem to determine what is the length of an NTMBS.<br>
An NTMBS is both a sequence of bytes with terminating null character(MTBS)
and a sequence of valid multibyte characters with
terminating null character. As an NTBS, its length is the count of non-null
bytes. As a sequence of valid multibyte characters,
its length is the count of multibyte characters
preceding the terminating null character.<br>
Unfortunately, there is no definition of the length of an NTMBS. So comes the ambiguity.<br>
<br>
<br>
5.2.1.2/1<br>
...<br>
— A multibyte character set may have a <i>state-dependent
encoding</i>, wherein each<br>
sequence of multibyte characters begins in an <i>initial
shift state</i> and enters other<br>
locale-specific <i>shift states</i> when specific multibyte
characters are encountered in the<br>
sequence. While in the initial shift state, all single-byte characters retain
their usual<br>
interpretation and do not alter the shift state. The interpretation for
subsequent bytes<br>
in the sequence is a function of the current shift state.<br>
<br>
Obviously, initial shift state is significant for processing of multibyte characters but not bytes. Thus the definition of
NTMBS suggests it should be treated as sequence of multibyte
character primarily if this definition is adopted.<br>
However, there are also some problems of several related terms in this ISO C
draft:<br>
<b>7.1.1 Definitions of terms</b><br>
1 A <i>string</i> is a contiguous sequence of characters terminated by and
including the first null<br>
character. The term <i>multibyte</i><i> string</i> is
sometimes used instead to emphasize special<br>
processing given to multibyte characters contained in
the string or to avoid confusion<br>
with a wide string. A <i>pointer to a string</i> is a pointer to its initial
(lowest addressed)<br>
character. The <i>length of a string</i> is the number of bytes preceding the
null character and<br>
the <i>value of a string</i> is the sequence of the values of the contained
characters, in order.<br>
4 A <i>wide string</i> is a contiguous sequence of wide characters terminated
by and including<br>
the first null wide character. A <i>pointer to a wide string</i> is a pointer
to its initial (lowest<br>
addressed) wide character. The <i>length of a wide string</i> is the number of
wide characters<br>
preceding the null wide character and the <i>value of a wide string</i> is the
sequence of code<br>
values of the contained wide characters, in order.<br>
<br>
The definition of "length of a string" slightly suggests that byte
count is fit for even multibyte strings in C.<br>
I have two questions about it, though probably out scope of ISO C:<br>
1. Why does the length of wide character string adopt "the number of wide
characters preceding the null wide character"?<br>
2. For example, should something "mbcslen"
just do the same thing as strlen does?<br>
<br>
PS2. Is there somewhere I can discuss some questions of ISO/IEC 9899, just as
talking about ISO/IEC 14882 here? I have found a probable defect in N1570(but no concern with C++).
